# Polarity Models Python
Code to run various polarity models.

Models in `src/models/`
Code to run models in `src/tasks/`
Can also run via `src/vary_parameters.py`

For the par3_addition model, `src/tasks/par3addition_parameter_space_test.py` gives code to generate plots showing polarity with two varied parameters.

`src/tasks/run_crumbs.py` and the "crumbs model" as a whole was an attempt to try force par3 junction localisation through our basic interactions
